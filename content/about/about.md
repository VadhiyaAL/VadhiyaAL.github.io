## Mechanical Engineer
   * I studies Mechanical Engineering in India, and have major respect to the field of study. 
   * I fell in love with thermodynamics, Machine Design. However, the Indian job market Mechanical engineering was beyond saturation at my time of graduation. Ended up getting job as Quality Engineering at small local companay, while I planned my futher study in Canada. 
   * **PS, on the side I learned Cyber Security and Web dev (from FreeCodeCamp), also on the side got a casual/temp job as Fraud Prevention Reperesentative at TTEC.**

## Quality Engineering And Satistics
  * I chose to study Quality Engineering Management in Canada, which introduced me to statistics. 
  * **I hated it!**, mainly because I did not focused and I also felt that the professor did not focused on the application part and kept teaching the methods.

  ### Certifications
   #### CQE (Certified Quality Engineer - ASQ)
   * This is where I shaprened my ststistis skills to a double edged sward. I become an expert or at least I think I am now. From mean, meadian, mode to Hypothesis tetsing, ANOVA and regression. That is becasue the this cert exam is dominated by the statistics question, mostly application based. 
   * **Now career in Data seemed possible for the first time, more importantly I found my passion for Data Analysis.** After that I got a job as Quality Speacialist at Allseating Corp, Mississauga (Currentlty working here).

   #### Certified Six Sigma Black Belt (ASQ)
   * I went for this cert beacuse, it was advised by ASQ community memeber that after CQE, Six Sigma certification is child's play. 
   * However I has its benefits like popular than CQE and also has high demand in job market. 
   * **I beileve that CQE has much more to offer as it is an engineeing cert, and Six Sigma is just and project management aproach to imporvements.**

## My learning so far in Data / IT

  * As Fruad Anlyst: Network log analysis, fraud patterns in activity logs, build workflow automation to reduce teams average handling time.
  * 2021 Responsive Web Design course with FreeCodeCamp
2022 Data Analysis:
  * Intro to relational databases: MS Access and SQL
  * Excel Power Query and PowerBI
  * Pandas and Matplotlib: Courses by Kaggle
2023 Machine Learning
  * Currently Learning Scikit.
